Why this trainer thrives in Qud in 2026  
- Simple: .exe → Caves of Qud → auto-load  
- Humanized closet: smoothing, realistic FOV, no obvious animations or stats spikes, preserves roguelike permadeath feel for challenge runs  
- No AC bypass needed — single-player roguelike, zero online checks  
- ESP: enemies (snapjaws, tunneelers, salamanders, vine beasts, snapjaws, rust thistles, ezkin, kites, briggan jerks, snapjaws, goatsuckers, seekers, glowing cudgel wielders), NPCs (true kin, mutants, saltmen, barathrans, snapjaws), loot (artifacts, books, scrolls, mutations, cybernetics, weapons, armor, food, drink), hidden vaults, quests, true kinship diplomacy, weak points on bosses/mutated enemies highlighted  
- Updates post-patch/DLC (new mutations like Photosynthesis upgrades, new cybernetics, new zones like Jhack Savanna expansions, new lore entries)  
- No key/sub — loader style  
- Windows 10/11 64-bit (Steam / GOG / itch.io)
